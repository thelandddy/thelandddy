Although payday loans are advertised as being helpful for unexpected or emergency expenses, 7 in 10 borrowers use them for regular, recurring expenses such as rent and utilities.
Auto title loans are similar to payday loans, except that the average loan is $1,000 and is secured by a borrowerâ€™s car title. Roughly 2.5 million Americans spend $3 billion on auto title loan fees each year.
Payday loans are available in 36 states, with annual percentage rates averaging 391 percent. The other states effectively prohibit these loans by capping rates at a low level or enforcing other laws.
