The loan daddy

The average payday loan requires a lump-sum repayment of $430 on the next payday, consuming 36 percent of an average borrowerâ€™s gross paycheck. However, research shows that most borrowers can afford no more than 5 percent while still covering basic expenses.
As a result, most borrowers renew or reborrow the loans. This explains why the CFPB found that 80 percent of payday loans are taken out within two weeks of repayment of a previous payday loan.
The payday lending business relies on extended indebtedness: three-quarters of payday loans go to those who take out 11 or more of the loans annually.
The payday loan market is not price competitive. Most lenders charge the maximum rate allowed under state law. States without rate limits have the highest prices.
